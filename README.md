# **User Experience (UX)**
The wireframes for the site were created in the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). The wireframes have been created for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. The text content wasn't finalized during the wireframe process. It's worth mentioning that there are some visual differences compared to the wireframes, the reason being design choices that was made during the creation process.

## User Stories
Below the user stories for the project are listed to clarify why particular feature matters. These will then be tested and confirmed in the [Testing](<#testing>) section.

## Design Choices

* ### Color Scheme

The color scheme chosen for the 'Review | Alliance' site was based on the Bootstrap dark background. The colors are Black (used on some text elements), Raisin Black (top navigation and footer), Rocket Metallic (used on most of the text elements), Cultured (body background) and White (used i.e. as card background). All colors are very clean and they create a professional look together and offers a good readability and contrast as well. I used the online service [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to choose the color scheme.

![Color Palette image](readme/assets/images/coolors_palette.png)

* ### Typography
The fonts used for the game are 'Roboto' and 'Tinos'. Fallback font for both of them is sans-serif.

* 'Roboto' is used on all headlines including the brand logo. It's a very clean font that works really well for headlines and logos. It's easy to read and matches the minimalistic style that I wanted the site to 'breath'.

* 'Tinos' was chosen for the review excerpt and the review full text. It has a nice serif design and works really well for longer paragraphs of text.

# Deployment

## Deployment To Heroku

The project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). To deploy, please follow the process below:

1. The first step is to log in to Heroku (or create an account if needed).

<details><summary><b>Heroku Step 1</b></summary>

![Heroku Step 1](readme/assets/images/heroku_step_1.png)
</details><br />

2. In the top right corner there is a button that is labeled 'New'. Click that and then select 'Create new app'.

<details><summary><b>Heroku Step 2</b></summary>

![Heroku Step 2](readme/assets/images/heroku_step_2.png)
</details><br />

3. Now it's time to enter an application name that needs to be unique. When you have chose the name, choose your region and click 'Create app".

<details><summary><b>Heroku Step 3</b></summary>

![Heroku Step 3](readme/assets/images/heroku_step_3.png)
</details><br />

4. On the next page, click the 'Settings' tab and find the "Config Vars" section. When you have found it, click "Reveal Config Vars". Now it's time to add values. In the 'WOM Record Collection' case I needed to add two values. The first one was the credentials (KEY input field = "CREDS", VALUE input field = "your credentials", I have blurred out my credentials for security reasons), click the 'Add' button. Next you need to add another key, enter "PORT" in the KEY input field and "8000" in the VALUE field, click the 'Add' button.

<details><summary><b>Heroku Step 4</b></summary>

![Heroku Step 4](readme/assets/images/heroku_step_4.png)
</details><br />

5. Next step is to add buildpacks to the application which will run when the application is deployed. The reason why this is needed is because all dependencies and configurations will be installed for the application. To do this you scroll down to the buildpacks section on the settings page and click the button 'Add buildpack'.

<details><summary><b>Heroku Step 5</b></summary>

![Heroku Step 5](readme/assets/images/heroku_step_5.png)
</details><br />

6. Add "Python" and node.js". It is important that Python is listed above node.js. If it's not you can sort it by dragging and dropping.

<details><summary><b>Heroku Step 6</b></summary>

![Heroku Step 6](readme/assets/images/heroku_step_6.png)
</details><br />

7. Now it's time for deployment. Scroll to the top of the settings page and click the 'Deploy' tab. For deployment method, select 'Github'. Search for the repository name you want to deploy and then click connect.

<details><summary><b>Heroku Step 7</b></summary>

![Heroku Step 7](readme/assets/images/heroku_step_7.png)
</details><br />

8. Scroll down on the deploy page and choose deployment type. Choose to enable automatic deployments if you want to and then  click 'Deploy Branch'.

<details><summary><b>Heroku Step 8</b></summary>

## How To Fork The Repository On GitHub

It is possible to do a copy of a GitHub Repository by forking the GitHub account. The copy can then be viewed and it is also possible to do changes in the copy without affecting the original repository. To fork the repository, take these steps:

1. After logging in to GitHub, locate the repository. On the top right side of the page there is a 'Fork' button. Click on the button to create a copy of the original repository.

<details><summary><b>Github Fork</b></summary>

3. Use an IDE and open Git Bash. Change directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
4. Type 'git clone', and then paste the URL that you copied from GitHub. Press enter and a local clone will be created.
